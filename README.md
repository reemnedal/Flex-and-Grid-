# Flex and Grid Task

This repository contains three tasks, each implemented in a separate file, where we utilized the properties of CSS Grid and Flexbox to create layout structures.

## Tasks Overview

Each task is implemented in a different file within this repository:

1. **Task 1:** [task1.html](task1.html)
2. **Task 2:** [task2.html](task2.html)
3. **Task 3:** [task3.html](task3.html)

## Usage of CSS Properties

In these tasks, we primarily utilized the following CSS properties:

- `grid-column`: Used to define the placement of elements along the column axis within a grid container.
- `grid-row`: Used to define the placement of elements along the row axis within a grid container.

These properties were crucial in dividing the pages into sections and arranging the content effectively.

Feel free to explore each task file to see how these properties were implemented and how the layouts were structured.
